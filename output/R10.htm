<td class="text">&#160;&#160;<span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:12pt;font-weight:bold;">MAJOR ACCOUNTING POLICIES</span><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Basis of Presentation and Consolidation Principles</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and include the accounts of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and those of its controlled subsidiaries (&#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;Air Products,&#8221; or &#8220;registrant&#8221;), which are generally majority owned. Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">We consolidate all entities that we control. The general condition for control is ownership of a majority of the voting interests of an entity. Control may also exist in arrangements where we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity (VIE). An entity that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of a VIE and the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits significant to the VIE is considered the primary beneficiary of that entity. We have determined that we are not a primary beneficiary in any material VIE.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">The results of operations and cash flows for our discontinued operations have been segregated from the results of continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. The assets and liabilities of the discontinued operations are segregated in the consolidated balance sheets. The comprehensive income related to discontinued operations has not been segregated and is included in the consolidated comprehensive income statement for all periods presented. Refer to Note </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">3</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">, </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Discontinued Operations</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">, for detail of the businesses presented in discontinued operations. </span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">The notes to the consolidated financial statements, unless otherwise indicated, are on a continuing operations basis. The term "total company" includes both continuing and discontinued operations.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Reclassifications</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">The consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes reflect accounting guidance that was adopted during fiscal year </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">2018</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">. Refer to Note </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">2</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">, </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">New Accounting Guidance</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">, for additional information. Certain prior year information has been reclassified to conform to the fiscal year </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">2018</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"> presentation.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Estimates and Assumptions</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Revenue Recognition</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Revenue from product sales is recognized as risk and title to the product transfer to the customer (which generally occurs at the time shipment is made), the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Sales returns and allowances are not a business practice in the industry.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Revenue from equipment sale contracts is recorded primarily using the percentage-of-completion method. Under this method, revenue from the sale of major equipment, such as liquefied natural gas (LNG) heat exchangers and large air separation units, is primarily recognized based on costs incurred to date compared with total estimated costs to be incurred. When adjustments in estimated total contract revenues or estimated total costs are required, any changes in the estimated profit from prior estimates are recognized in the current period for the inception-to-date effect of such change. Changes in estimates on projects accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method favorably impacted operating income by approximately </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><span>$38</span></span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">, </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><span>$27</span></span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">, and </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><span>$20</span></span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"> in fiscal years </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">2018</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">, </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">2017</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">, and </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">2016</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">, respectively. Our changes in estimates would not have significantly impacted amounts recorded in prior years. </span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Certain contracts associated with facilities that are built to provide product to a specific customer are required to be accounted for as leases. In cases where operating lease treatment is appropriate, there is no difference in revenue recognition over the life of the contract as compared to accounting for the contract as product sales. In cases where capital lease treatment is appropriate, the timing of revenue and expense recognition is impacted. Revenue and expense are recognized up front for the sale of equipment component of the contract as compared to revenue recognition over the life of the arrangement under contracts not qualifying as capital leases. Additionally, a portion of the revenue representing interest income from the financing component of the lease receivable is reflected as sales over the life of the contract. Allowances for credit losses associated with capital lease receivables are recorded using the specific identification method. As of </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">30 September 2018</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"> and </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">2017</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">, the credit quality of capital lease receivables did not require a material allowance for credit losses.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">If an arrangement involves multiple deliverables, the delivered items are considered separate units of accounting if the items have value on a stand-alone basis. Revenues are allocated to each deliverable based upon relative selling prices derived from company specific evidence.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Amounts billed for shipping and handling fees are classified as sales in the consolidated income statements.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Amounts billed for sales and use taxes, value-added taxes, and certain excise and other specific transactional taxes imposed on revenue-producing transactions are presented on a net basis and excluded from sales in the consolidated income statements. We record a liability until remitted to the respective taxing authority.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Cost of Sales</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Cost of sales predominantly represents the cost of tangible products sold. These costs include labor, raw materials, plant engineering, power, depreciation, production supplies and materials packaging costs, and maintenance costs. Costs incurred for shipping and handling are also included in cost of sales.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Depreciation</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method, which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings every year over its expected economic useful life. The principal lives for major classes of plant and equipment are summarized in Note </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">9</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">, </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Plant and Equipment, net</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Selling and Administrative</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">The principal components of selling and administrative expenses are compensation, advertising, and promotional costs. Selling and administrative expenses also include costs for functional support previously provided to the former Electronic Materials and Performance Materials Divisions and in support of transition services agreements with Versum and with Evonik, for which the reimbursement is reflected in "Other income (expense), net" on our consolidated income statements.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Postemployment Benefits</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">We provide termination benefits to employees as part of ongoing benefit arrangements and record a liability for termination benefits when probable and estimable. These criteria are met when management, with the appropriate level of authority, approves and commits to its plan of action for termination; the plan identifies the employees to be terminated and their related benefits; and the plan is to be completed within one year. We do not provide material one-time benefit arrangements.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Fair Value Measurements</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">We are required to measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value, either upon initial measurement or for subsequent accounting or reporting. For example, fair value is used in the initial measurement of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination; on a recurring basis in the measurement of derivative financial instruments; and on a nonrecurring basis when long-lived assets are written down to fair value when held for sale or determined to be impaired. Refer to Note </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">14</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">, </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Fair Value Measurements</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">, and Note </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">16</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">, Retirement Benefits, for information on the methods and assumptions used in our fair value measurements.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Financial Instruments</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">We address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. The types of derivative financial instruments permitted for such risk management programs are specified in policies set by management. Refer to Note </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">13</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">, </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Financial Instruments</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">, for further detail on the types and use of derivative instruments into which we enter.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Major financial institutions are counterparties to all of these derivative contracts. We have established counterparty credit guidelines and generally enter into transactions with financial institutions of investment grade or better. Management believes the risk of incurring losses related to credit risk is remote, and any losses would be immaterial to the consolidated financial results, financial condition, or liquidity.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">We recognize derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. On the date the derivative instrument is entered into, we generally designate the derivative as either (1)&#160;a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (cash flow hedge), (2)&#160;a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedge), or (3)&#160;a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability (fair value hedge).</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">The following details the accounting treatment of our cash flow, fair value, net investment, and non-designated hedges:</span></div><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="padding-top:8px;font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:10pt;"><tr><td style="width:20px;"/><td/></tr><tr><td style="vertical-align:top"><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;padding-left:-4px;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">&#8226;</span></div></td><td style="vertical-align:top;"><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as and meets the cash flow hedge criteria are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL) to the extent effective and then recognized in earnings when the hedged items affect earnings.</span></div></td></tr></table><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="padding-top:8px;font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:10pt;"><tr><td style="width:20px;"/><td/></tr><tr><td style="vertical-align:top"><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;padding-left:-4px;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">&#8226;</span></div></td><td style="vertical-align:top;"><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as and meets all the required criteria for a fair value hedge, along with the gain or loss on the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in current period earnings.</span></div></td></tr></table><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="padding-top:8px;font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:10pt;"><tr><td style="width:20px;"/><td/></tr><tr><td style="vertical-align:top"><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;padding-left:-4px;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">&#8226;</span></div></td><td style="vertical-align:top;"><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Changes in the fair value of a derivative and foreign currency debt that are designated as and meet all the required criteria for a hedge of a net investment are recorded as translation adjustments in AOCL.</span></div></td></tr></table><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="padding-top:8px;font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:10pt;"><tr><td style="width:20px;"/><td/></tr><tr><td style="vertical-align:top"><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;padding-left:-4px;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">&#8226;</span></div></td><td style="vertical-align:top;"><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is not designated as a hedge are recorded immediately in earnings.</span></div></td></tr></table><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">We formally document the relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes relating derivatives that are designated as fair value or cash flow hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. We also formally assess, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether derivatives are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge, or if a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge, we will discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Foreign Currency</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Since we do business in many foreign countries, fluctuations in currency exchange rates affect our financial position and results of operations.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">In most of our foreign operations, the local currency is considered the functional currency. Foreign subsidiaries translate their assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates in effect at the end of the fiscal period. The gains or losses that result from this process are shown as translation adjustments in AOCL in the equity section of the balance sheet.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">The revenue and expense accounts of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates that prevail during the period. Therefore, the U.S. dollar value of these items on the consolidated income statements fluctuates from period to period, depending on the value of the dollar against foreign currencies. Some transactions are made in currencies different from an entity&#8217;s functional currency. Gains and losses from these foreign currency transactions are generally reflected in "Other income (expense), net" on our consolidated income statements as they occur.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Environmental Expenditures</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Accruals for environmental loss contingencies are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Remediation costs are capitalized if the costs improve the Company&#8217;s property as compared with the condition of the property when originally constructed or acquired, or if the costs prevent environmental contamination from future operations. We expense environmental costs related to existing conditions resulting from past or current operations and from which no current or future benefit is discernible. The amounts charged to income from continuing operations related to environmental matters totaled </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><span>$12.8</span></span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">, </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><span>$11.4</span></span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">, and </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><span>$12.2</span></span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"> in fiscal years </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">2018</span><span style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">, </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">2017</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">, and </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">2016</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">, respectively.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">The measurement of environmental liabilities is based on an evaluation of currently available information with respect to each individual site and considers factors such as existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites. An environmental liability related to cleanup of a contaminated site might include, for example, a provision for one or more of the following types of costs: site investigation and testing costs, remediation costs, post-remediation monitoring costs, natural resource damages, and outside legal fees. These liabilities include costs related to other potentially responsible parties to the extent that we have reason to believe such parties will not fully pay their proportionate share. They do not consider any claims for recoveries from insurance or other parties and are not discounted.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">As assessments and remediation progress at individual sites, the amount of projected cost is reviewed, and the liability is adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available. Management has an established process in place to identify and monitor the Company&#8217;s environmental exposures. An environmental accrual analysis is prepared and maintained that lists all environmental loss contingencies, even where an accrual has not been established. This analysis assists in monitoring the Company&#8217;s overall environmental exposure and serves as a tool to facilitate ongoing communication among the Company&#8217;s technical experts, environmental managers, environmental lawyers, and financial management to ensure that required accruals are recorded and potential exposures disclosed.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures, actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates. Refer to Note </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">17</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">, </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Commitments and Contingencies</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">, for additional information on the Company&#8217;s environmental loss contingencies.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">The accruals for environmental liabilities are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets, primarily as part of other noncurrent liabilities.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Litigation</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">In the normal course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings. We accrue a liability for such matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. The accrual for a litigation loss contingency includes estimates of potential damages and other directly related costs expected to be incurred. Refer to Note </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">17</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">, </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Commitments and Contingencies</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">, for additional information on our current legal proceedings.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Share-Based Compensation</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">We have various share-based compensation programs, which include deferred stock units, stock options, and restricted stock. We expense the grant-date fair value of these awards over the vesting period during which employees perform related services. Expense recognition is accelerated for retirement-eligible individuals who would meet the requirements for vesting of awards upon their retirement. Refer to Note </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">19</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">, </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Share-Based Compensation</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">, for additional information regarding these awards and the models and assumptions used to determine the grant-date fair value of our awards.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Income Taxes</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A principal temporary difference results from the excess of tax depreciation over book depreciation because accelerated methods of depreciation and shorter useful lives are used for income tax purposes. The cumulative impact of a change in tax rates or regulations is included in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date. We recognize deferred tax assets net of existing valuation allowances to the extent we believe that these assets are more likely than not to be realized considering all available evidence. </span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">A tax benefit for an uncertain tax position is recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination based on its technical merits. This position is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of income tax expense.

Interest income in previous periods was included in "Other income (expense), net." In addition, other non-operating income (expense), net includes non-service cost components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost. Our non-service costs primarily include interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of actuarial gains and losses, and settlements.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Cash and Cash Items</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Cash and cash items include cash, time deposits, treasury securities, and certificates of deposit acquired with an original maturity of three months or less.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Short-term Investments</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Short-term investments include time deposits and certificates of deposit with original maturities greater than three months and less than one year.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Trade Receivables, net</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Trade receivables comprise amounts owed to us through our operating activities and are presented net of allowances for doubtful accounts. The allowances for doubtful accounts represent estimated uncollectible receivables associated with potential customer defaults on contractual obligations. A provision for customer defaults is made on a general formula basis when it is determined that the risk of some default is probable and estimable but cannot yet be associated with specific customers. The assessment of the likelihood of customer defaults is based on various factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due, historical experience, and existing economic conditions. The allowance also includes amounts for certain customers where a risk of default has been specifically identified, considering factors such as the financial condition of the customer and customer disputes over contractual terms and conditions. Allowances for doubtful accounts were </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><span>$91.3</span></span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"> and </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><span>$93.5</span></span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"> as of </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">30 September 2018</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"> and </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">2017</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">, respectively. Provisions to the allowance for doubtful accounts charged against income were </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><span>$24.0</span></span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">, </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><span>$45.8</span></span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">, and </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><span>$21.8</span></span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"> in fiscal years </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">2018</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">, </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">2017</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">, and </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">2016</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">, respectively.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Inventories</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">We carry inventory on our consolidated balance sheets that is comprised of finished goods, work-in-process, raw materials and supplies. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We write down our inventories for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Effective 1 July 2018, we changed our accounting method for U.S. industrial gases inventories from a last-in, first-out basis (LIFO) to a first-in, first-out basis (FIFO). Previously, the LIFO&#160;method was used to determine the cost of industrial gases inventories in the United States. We believe this change in accounting method is preferable as it is consistent with how we manage our business, results in a uniform method to value our inventory across all regions of our business, improves comparability with our peers, and is expected to better reflect the current value of inventory on the consolidated balance sheets. We applied this accounting change as a cumulative effect adjustment to cost of sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 and did not restate prior period financial statements because the impact was not material.

Under the equity method, original investments are recorded at cost and adjusted by our share of undistributed earnings or losses of these companies. Equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Plant and Equipment, Net</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Plant and equipment, net is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Construction costs, labor, and applicable overhead related to installations are capitalized. Expenditures for additions and improvements that extend the lives or increase the capacity of plant assets are capitalized. The costs of maintenance and repairs of plant and equipment are charged to expense as incurred.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Fully depreciated assets are retained in the gross plant and equipment and accumulated depreciation accounts until they are removed from service. In the case of disposals, assets, and related depreciation are removed from the accounts, and the net amounts, less proceeds from disposal, are included in income. Refer to Note </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">9</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">, </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Plant and Equipment, net</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">, for further detail.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Computer Software</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">We capitalize costs incurred to purchase or develop software for internal use. Capitalized costs include purchased computer software packages, payments to vendors/consultants for development and implementation or modification to a purchased package to meet our requirements, payroll and related costs for employees directly involved in development, and interest incurred while software is being developed. Capitalized computer software costs are reflected in "Plant and equipment, net" on the consolidated balance sheets and are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the software, generally a period of </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">three</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"> to </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">five</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"> years.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Capitalized Interest</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">As we build new plant and equipment, we include in the cost of these assets a portion of the interest payments we make during the year. The amount of capitalized interest was </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><span>$19.5</span></span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">, </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><span>$19.0</span></span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">, and </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><span>$32.7</span></span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"> in fiscal years </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">2018</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">, </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">2017</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">, and </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">2016</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">, respectively.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Impairment of Long-Lived Assets</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Long-lived assets are grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. We assess recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group. If an asset group is considered impaired, the impairment loss to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the asset group&#8217;s carrying amount exceeds its fair value. Long-lived assets meeting the held for sale criteria are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Asset Retirement Obligations</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">The fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred. The fair value of the liability is measured using discounted estimated cash flows and is adjusted to its present value in subsequent periods as accretion expense is recorded. The corresponding asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset&#8217;s useful life. Our asset retirement obligations are primarily associated with on-site long-term supply contracts under which we have built a facility on land owned by the customer and are obligated to remove the facility at the end of the contract term. Our asset retirement obligations totaled </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><span>$190.4</span></span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"> and </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"><span>$144.7</span></span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"> at </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">30 September 2018</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"> and </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">2017</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">, respectively.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Goodwill</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. Any excess purchase price (plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest and previously held equity interest in the acquiree) over the fair market value of the net assets acquired, including identified intangibles, is recorded as goodwill. Preliminary purchase price allocations are made at the date of acquisition and finalized when information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date needed to finalize underlying estimates is obtained or when we determine that such information is not obtainable, within a maximum allocation period of </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">one</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"> year.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Goodwill is subject to impairment testing at least annually. In addition, goodwill is tested more frequently if a change in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicates that potential impairment exists.

Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade names and trademarks. Indefinite-lived intangibles are subject to impairment testing at least annually. In addition, intangible assets are tested more frequently if a change in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicates that potential impairment exists.</span></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;font-size:10pt;"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">Customer relationships are generally amortized over periods of </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">five</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"> to </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">twenty-five</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"> years.

Land use rights, which are included in other intangibles, are generally amortized over a period of </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;">fifty</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;"> years. Amortizable lives are adjusted whenever there is a change in the estimated period of economic benefit.
